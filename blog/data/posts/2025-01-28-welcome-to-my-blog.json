I'm Prajyoth, and I'm excited to share my journey in technology, AI, and all the cool stuff I'm building.\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThis blog is where I'll be sharing:\n\n- **Technical deep-dives** into projects I'm working on\n- **AI and Machine Learning** insights from my research at IIT Bombay\n- **Web development** tips and tricks I've learned\n- **Hardware projects** and robotics experiments\n- **Random thoughts** about technology and life\n\n## A Bit About Me\n\nI'm currently an Electronics & Communications student at SR University, but my interests span way beyond traditional ECE. I love:\n\n- Building things that solve real problems\n- Exploring the intersection of AI and hardware\n- Writing code that doesn't look like it's from the 90s\n- Making chai at 3 AM while debugging\n\n## What's Coming Next\n\nI've got some exciting posts planned:\n\n- How I built this blog system (spoiler: it's all client-side!)\n- My experience with Graph Neural Networks in catalyst design\n- Building a social app for 800+ students\n- Tips for getting into research as an undergrad\n\n## Let's Connect\n\nI'd love to hear from you! Whether you want to discuss a project, share ideas, or just say hi, feel free to reach out.\n\nThanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting here!\n\n---\n\n*P.S. - This entire blog runs on vanilla JavaScript and GitHub Pages. No servers, no costs, just pure client-side magic. I'll write about how I built it soon!*",
