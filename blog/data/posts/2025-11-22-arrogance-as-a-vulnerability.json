  "content": "# Case Study: Arrogance as a Vulnerability – The $1M \"Hope\"\r\n\r\n**Date:** November 21, 2025  \r\n**The Setting:** A Founder \"War Room\" WhatsApp Group  \r\n**The Ask:** $1,000,000 Valuation  \r\n\r\n## Phase 1: The Pitch (12:28 PM)\r\nIt started with a pitch. A founder dropped his link—`lazyjobseeker.com`—claiming to be a \"one-man army\" with **90% profit margins** and a \"reverse psychology\" marketing strategy. \"Attention is all we need,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe was building an automation tool for job seekers. A tool to cheat the system, built by a guy trying to shortcut the due diligence process.\r\n\r\nWhen someone asked about data safety, he replied with the line that sealed his fate:\r\n> *\"And our firebase is hopefully tightly secured\"*\r\n\r\n**\"Hopefully.\"**\r\n\r\nThat word triggered me. In engineering, \"hope\" isn't a strategy; it's a liability.\r\n\r\n## Phase 2: The Audit (12:40 PM)\r\nI didn't launch a cyberattack. I just opened the Chrome Developer Console (`F12`). What I found wasn't just a vulnerability; it was negligence masquerading as a business.\r\n\r\n### 1. The \"Naked\" Paradox\r\nHere is the irony: His core feature—resume parsing—was actually done **on-device** (client-side). Technically, he had built a privacy-preserving feature! He didn't need to send user resumes to the cloud.\r\n**The Reality:** He built a private room inside a glass house. He was \"naked but roaming otherwise.\" He protected the resume parsing but left the user's Identity, Phone Number, and Payment History exposed to the public internet.\r\n\r\n### 2. The Data Leak (IDOR)\r\nHe had panicked and disabled the `list` permission on Firestore, thinking that if I couldn't *see* the list, I couldn't find the users.\r\n**The Exploit:** He left `get` open without ownership checks (`allow get: if request.auth != null`).\r\nSince I had cached the User IDs during the initial load, I didn't need to list them. I just asked for them by name.\r\n**Result:** Access to **6,039 records**.\r\n\r\n### 3. The \"Raviteja\" Variance (Fake Revenue)\r\nHe pitched \"$2k MRR\" and \"2,000 users.\"\r\nI queried the globally readable `razorpayOrders` collection.\r\n**The Truth:**\r\n* **Real Active Users:** ~50.\r\n* **Lifetime \"Whales\":** Exactly 7 (one of which was me testing).\r\n* **The \"Profit\":** Hundreds of transactions for ₹1 initiated by internal accounts: `raviteja@...`, `admin@...`, and `test@...`.\r\nHe wasn't generating revenue; he was generating logs. He was pitching his own testing history as investor-grade growth.\r\n\r\n### 4. The Wallet Drain\r\n* **Cloud Run:** Public endpoint (`--allow-unauthenticated`) for PDF conversion.\r\n* **Gemini API:** Hardcoded in `main.js`. Anyone could drain his credits in minutes.\r\n\r\n## Phase 3: The Warning (1:00 PM)\r\nI tried to be the \"Good Guy.\" I posted a detailed message in the group.\r\nI told him: *\"I could have DM'd you, but confidence without competence is a liability.\"*\r\nI listed the leaks. I warned him about the fake revenue exposure. I told him I just saved him a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n## Phase 4: The Arrogant Response\r\nA smart founder fixes the bug. This founder chose to fight the auditor.\r\nHe replied with insults:\r\n> *\"Congratulations on downloading public email IDs... Next time try opening something more challenging than Inspect Element.\"*\r\n> *\"You saved yourself from embarrassing the last 3 neurons you have left.\"*\r\n\r\nAnd then, the fatal error. He challenged me:\r\n> **\"If you genuinely think you discovered something, send me one user’s private data. One.\"**\r\n\r\n## Phase 5: The Trap & The Originals\r\nHe thought he was clever. Between my warning and his challenge, he had likely silently patched the vulnerability (or asked his LLM to fix the rules). He was betting that if I tried to run the script *now*, it would fail, and he could claim I was lying.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not an idiot. I knew he would try to cover his tracks.\r\n\r\nI didn't need to fetch the data *again*. I had already downloaded the dump during the audit.\r\n\r\nAs PK said in *Gudumba Shankar*:\r\n> **\"Till the job is done, keep the originals with you and deal with duplicates.\"**\r\n\r\nI had the originals. I was ready to drop the specific JSON record (User: Sae Sudha, Plan: Ultimate) to prove it.\r\n\r\n## Phase 6: Justice Interruptus\r\nBefore I could hit send and expose his bluff, the Group Admins removed him.\r\nHe was kicked out for his arrogance before I could prove his incompetence.\r\n\r\n## Phase 7: The Aftermath\r\nHe is gone, but the lesson remains.\r\nHe built a tool for \"Lazy Job Seekers\" to cheat the hiring process, while he himself was a \"Lazy Founder\" trying to cheat the investment process.\r\n\r\nHe thought because he was kicked, he escaped the truth. But I still have the logs.\r\n\r\n**To the investors:** Audit the Firebase rules.\r\n**To the founder:** Stop the \"Mosam\" (Fraud).\r\n**To the users:** Your data deserves better than \"Hope.\""
